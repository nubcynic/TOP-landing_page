# Project: Landing Page (TheOdinProject Foundations Course)

This project is about creating an entire web page from a design that is already provided. The design comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and another has some details about the fonts and colors.


## Project Description

This project tests your knowledge on CSS-Flexbox. You are required to create a responsive landing page as close to the provided design image as possible using HTML and CSS. You will only be using the recently learned Flexbox techniques.
The design image only incudes basic layouts with fillers as the contents. You are required to research on your own and fill the content with appropriate images, texts, logos, icons and more.
Make sure the contents you use inside are free to use and/or provide proper credit to the original owner.


## Reference Image for layout design
Your project is based on the image design provided. Image 01 consists of a website with dummy content. Image 02 consists of fonts and styles that can be used to make it attractive.
